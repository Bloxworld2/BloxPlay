            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>BrickPlayer is a custom client for Brick-Hill with improved graphics, performance, and several other features missing from the official client.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Please keep in mind that BrickPlayer is in early beta, and I am unable to supply quick updates due to a busy schedule. If you encounter any issues, please report them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/vZHzwsy">Ty Development Discord server</a>.</p>

            <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>Download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4jv9rbi1mekq4n/BrickPlayer%20Installer.zip?dl=1">this random zip file</a> and extract it somewhere. Then, run the <b>BrickPlayerInstaller.msi</b> file. This will install the BrickPlayer launcher, client, and protocol.</p>
            <p>Next, install the extension for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/buj71q00672jvk1/BrickPlayer_Chrome-1.7.zip?dl=1">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brickplayer-game-launcher/">Firefox</a> (thanks to Dragonian!). This will allow you to join games from the site.</p>
            <p>Finally, find a game on Brick-Hill and there will be a second play button that launches the game in BrickPlayer.</p>
